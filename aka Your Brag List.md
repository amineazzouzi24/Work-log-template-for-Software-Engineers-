# Work-log-template-for-Software-Engineers-


Writing and recording your work is essential, especially for software engineers. Each week, I wrote down the most important work items I worked on: major code changes, code reviews, design documentation, discussions and planning, helping others, analyzing results, and anything else that took time and has many benefits: not only for performance reviews, but also for your own sense of accomplishment! Feel free to use this document as an inspiration.
